# NEAR for Wordpress

## Building NEAR Wordpress plugin

In this documentation I’m going to show you how to use near wordpress plugin on your website.
The plugin is developed with NEAR-API-JS library. near-api-js is a JavaScript library for development of decentralized applications on the NEAR platform. It works in conjunction with our RPC endpoints to help you connect your application to the NEAR blockchain.
First ,you should download the NEAR plugin by cloning this repo or simply download it and activate it.
Near plugin will give you a shortcode that you can use it inside of your page or post content.
The shortcode is “[NEAR]”





When you do what mentioned above, you can see a section created where ever you used it before, like this:
 
![NEAR plugin](/images/screenshot.png "NEAR plugin")

If you click on the login button, It redirects you to official NEAR website to connect near plugin to your near wallet.
After you’re connected to your wallet you’ll be able to see your account id and balance and doing other actions.
